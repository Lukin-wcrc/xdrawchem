To install XDrawChem:

Two methods.  Simpler, using qmake:
0) Install qt-3.3 and openbabel-(latest).
1) Change to directory "xdrawchem" and edit xdrawchem.pro, checking install (PREFIX) and OpenBabel paths.
2) "qmake"
3) "make"
4) (as root) "make install"

Possibly more complex, but more automated when it works:
1) Download and install Qt-3.0 (or later) from http://www.trolltech.com/ if
   it is not already installed on your system.
   You must also install OpenBabel 2.0 or later from 
   http://openbabel.sourceforge.net/
   You should also obtain and install BUILD3D from the Files section of 
   the sourceforge.net project web page:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdrawchem

   The "configure" script checks for the presence of Qt and OpenBabel, as
   well as for the correct version.

   Some users have reported compile problems with gcc 3.0 and 3.2 series
   compilers.  We recommend upgrading to gcc 3.3 or later.

2) Type "./configure".
   This will build and install XDrawChem and OpenBabel.

   Then type "make", followed by (as root) "make install"

After installation:
3) Type "xdrawchem" to run the program.  Also, you may wish to type
   "xdrawchem --help", as XDrawChem supports some command line functions.

4) Setting the environment variable XDC_SERVER will override the XDC_SERVER
   set in the Makefile.

Enjoy!

Fixing some build issues:
Issue: error message about "automake-X.YY is missing"
Re-build the configure script with "aclocal; automake; autoconf"
Then re-run "./configure" and "make"
