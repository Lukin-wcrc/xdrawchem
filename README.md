# XDrawChem: a two-dimensional molecule drawing program

Welcome to XDrawChem!

Please visit the project page at http://www.woodsidelabs.com/chemistry/xdrawchem.php

Current release (1.10.1-1) source tarball, as well as RPM and Mac DMG binaries are available via SourceForge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/xdrawchem/files/xdrawchem/1.10.1/

### Installation

The current source code is in the xdrawchem-qt5 folder (v1.9.11 onwards).  It requires OpenBabel 3.x and Qt 5.x.  Please see the INSTALL document in xdrawchem-qt5 for installation directions.

### Other stuff

This repository conatins two legacy versions of XDrawChem:

legacy-xdrawchem-qt3 - this is the legacy Qt3 version (1.9.10 and prior).  It is based on Qt 3.x.

legacy-xdrawchem-qt4 - this is a contributed version.  It is based on Qt 4.
   However, most distributions are based on Qt 3.  The Qt 4 version is the basis of WinDrawChem.

Enjoy!
