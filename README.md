# xdrawchem

Welcome to XDrawChem!

Please visit the project page at http://www.woodsidelabs.com/chemistry/xdrawchem.php

Current release (1.9.11-1) source tarball and RPM are at SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xdrawchem/files/xdrawchem/1.9.10/

This repository conatins three (!) versions of XDrawChem:

xdrawchem-qt5 - this is the main development and release version (1.9.11 onwards).  It is based on Qt 5.x.
(Starting with 1.10.x, this will be "xdrawchem" and the legacy version will be "xdrawchem-qt3")

xdrawchem - this is the legacy Qt3 version (1.9.10 and prior).  It is based on Qt 3.x.

xdrawchem-qt4 - this is a contributed version.  It is based on Qt 4.
   Eventually, this will become the main version, but most distributions
   are still based on Qt 3.  The Qt 4 version is the basis of WinDrawChem.

Enjoy!
