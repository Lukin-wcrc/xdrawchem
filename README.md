This repository conatins three (!) versions of XDrawChem:

xdrawchem-qt5 - this is the main development and release version (1.9.11 onwards).  It is based on Qt 5.x.

legacy-xdrawchem-qt3 - this is the legacy Qt3 version (1.9.10 and prior).  It is based on Qt 3.x.

legacy-xdrawchem-qt4 - this is a contributed version.  It is based on Qt 4.
   However, most distributions are based on Qt 3.  The Qt 4 version is the basis of WinDrawChem.

Enjoy!
