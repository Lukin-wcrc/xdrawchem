Current release (1.9.10-1) source tarball and RPM are at SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xdrawchem/files/xdrawchem/1.9.10/

This package conatins two versions of XDrawChem:

xdrawchem - this is the main development version.  It is based on Qt 3.x.

xdrawchem-qt4 - this is a contributed version.  It is based on Qt 4.
   Eventually, this will become the main version, but most distributions
   are still based on Qt 3.  The Qt 4 version is the basis of WinDrawChem.

Enjoy!
