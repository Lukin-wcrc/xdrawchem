XDrawChem is available in binary format from SourceForge and several common package repositories.

To build and install XDrawChem from GitHub source:

1) Install recent Qt 5.x from packages or source.
Build and install OpenBabel from current GitHub release at https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel
If installing from packages, please also install the "devel" packages as well, e.g. qt5-qtbase-devel.
XDrawChem is built with Qt 5.6 and OpenBabel 3.0
Please file an issue on GitHub if these versions or newer fail.

2) Type "qmake".
   This will generate the XDrawChem Makefiles.

   Then type "make" to build, followed by (as root or sudo) "make install" to install.
   
   Please report any issues on GitHub, including full console output of build/install.

After installation:
3) Type "xdrawchem" to run the program.  Also, you may wish to type
   "xdrawchem --help", as XDrawChem supports some command line functions.

4) Setting the environment variable XDC_SERVER will override the XDC_SERVER
   set in the Makefile.

Enjoy!
