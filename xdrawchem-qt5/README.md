XDrawchem, Qt5 version

Requires OpenBabel (3.0 or later, build from source) and Qt (5.6 or later, again get all devel packages!)

Please see INSTALL.txt for full build and install instructions.

This code builds and is mostly functional.  It should compile with "qmake" (or "qmake-qt5" if required to select version 5) followed by "make"

You'll probably need to copy manually the contents of the ring folder to /usr/local/share/xdrawchem and copy the doc folder into the above path (as /usr/local/share/xdrawchem/doc)
